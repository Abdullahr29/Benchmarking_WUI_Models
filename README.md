# Benchmarking_WUI_Models
This project is part of my PhD on wildfire spread and impacts in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI). This repository contains code for the benchmarking of various WUI models and their benchmarking and validation against the Valparaiso, Chile 2024 and Lahaina Maui, Hawaii 2023 fires. Currently in progress.
